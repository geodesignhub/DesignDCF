# Design Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
This plugin downloads a design using the Geodesign Hub [API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api/), computes its area and construction costs and provides a [Discounted Cash Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow) analysis to calculate Net Present Value of this design. Choose the WACC and click on Compute NPV, then you can copy paste it in Excel.
